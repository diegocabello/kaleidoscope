Farnese is a mature woman, appearing to be in her early thirties. Her clothing reflects her upper-class status, often seen donning high-collared gowns and ornate jewelry indicative of her wealthy origins. Her attire is predominantly black or deep purple, with gold accents and intricate designs that are symbolic of her prestigous lineage. She carries a stern, somber expression that is a mere mirror of her serious nature. Her fair skin, offset by her long curly jet black hair that often cascades over her shoulders, bringing out the cool blue of her sharp, discerning eyes. Her face, though beautiful, bears lines of worry and stress from her responsibilities, particularly visible when she frowns. 

Farnese carries herself with a stately elegance, every movement calculated, reflecting her disciplined upbringing. She usually holds her head high, showcasing her strong jawline and her slender neck, but at times resentment and weariness seep through this demeanor, causing her shoulders to slope. Even her gestures, from the way she adjusts the small, delicate rings on her fingers to the way she manages her long skirts, radiate a sense of authority and dominance. Her color scheme, monochromatic with pops of gold, translates to her character as an elegant, powerful, yet troubled individual.
