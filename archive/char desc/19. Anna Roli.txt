Anna Roli is a woman of late middle age, with visible but elegant signs of aging. She wears regal attire, reminiscent of the late 18th-century fashion, consisting of a high-waist empire gown with long, slender sleeves, in shades of soft pastels and adorned with intricate lace. A bonnet styled with soft curls peeking underneath, lends a reassuring gentility to her overall attire. Her skin is pale but with a warm undertone that hints at her generous nature.

Her emerald green eyes, shielded by long and wispy lashes, hide a streak of steel and determination. Her lips are thin and delicate, with a penchant to break into a warm smile when least expected. She carries herself with a stoic grace mirroring her strong character, a mannerism that sets her apart in her era. Her movements are measured with an interesting blend of smoothness and precision, hinting at the intense discipline ingrained in her from her meticulous lifestyle. Her appearance is the perfect portrayal of strength and determination coated generously with warmth and kindness.
