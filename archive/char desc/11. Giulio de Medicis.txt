Giulio de' Medici, a man in his late fifties, is characterized by his experienced and regal aura. With the aging wisps of charcoal black hair tucked beneath his velvet red hat, a tribute to his cardinal status, his mature appearance commands respect. His dark, piercing eyes bear a studious yet cunning demeanor, reflecting the strategic skill nurtured during his political reign. As the de facto ruler of Florence, his dress is often a wonder of the Renaissance fashion - tunics of luxurious deep purples and blues embroidered with the Medici's emblem stitched with real gold threads, padded shoulders portraying a robust silhouette. 

He bears the deliberate movements of a man maneuvering a game of chess, corresponding with his reputation as a careful diplomat. His skin, though now lined with signs of age, still holds a hint of the olive complexion from his youth. His facial features are sharp, with a hawk-like nose and stern jawline. He often wears a thin, calculating smile that seldom reaches his shrewd eyes, a signature mannerism of his often introspective thoughtfulness.
