Abondia Rezzonica is an older woman, appearing around her late 60s. She has a dignity about her that suggests a lifetime of authority and respect. Her attire is tastefully refined without being ostentatious, favoring traditional gowns in interpretations of Romanesque-fashion, heavily embellished with intricate embroidery and accessorized with timeless pieces of understated jewelry. A rich palette of warm colors, including maroon, gold, and deep olive greens, emphasize her regality and noble stature. 

Her face carries the tell-tale signs of time, a smattering of wrinkles finely etched around her sharp, discerning eyes that hold a dignified spark behind squared spectacles. The soft puff of her thin lips typical of older age is balanced by her sharp cheekbones and rigid jawline. Her thin white hair, coiffed immaculately in a sophisticated updo, testifies to her age and her unspoken rule about personal presentation. While her movements have slowed over the years, there remains a certain crisp certainty to her gestures, each one revealing her awareness of her surrounding environment and the self-assuredness that comes from years of experience.
