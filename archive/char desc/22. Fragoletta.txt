Fragoletta, as gleaned from the text, appears to be a charming woman in her late twenties. Her attire tends toward the stylish yet unconventional side, often spotted in a frock of forest green or rich mahogany, a gentle nod to her lively spirit and possibly her love for Mother Nature. Her skirts often reached just below the knees - a controversial length for her era, adorning her slender, lively legs. Her rich chestnut hair cascades down to her shoulders in soft waves, pinned occasionally with an array of unusual but enchanting hair clips ranging from golden leaves to silver bird feathers. She has a heart-shaped face with a chiseled jawline, a pert little nose, and vivid, enigmatic hazel eyes that hold the capacity to bewitch recently acquainted and long-known alike. 

Fragoletta's mannerisms often reflect a distinct blend of vivacious charm and sophistication. She embodies a fluid grace in her movements, with a slight bounce in her stride that goads life into most dull and drab high-street encounters. Her laughter is a pleasing sound, bubbling up from her throat and setting a musical cadence to the surrounding atmosphere. When she talks, her hands come alive in a delicate dance illustrating her stories with faceting vividity. Her face is a canvas for her emotions- joy decorating her features into a breathtaking landscape of delight, sorrow molding them into an eloquent ode of soulful poignancy. She is a kaleidoscope of colours and emotions, an enchanting puzzle that one would take a lifetime to solve, and that would still be worth it.
