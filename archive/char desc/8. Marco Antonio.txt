Marco Antonio is a man in his late forties, his age betrayed only by the distinguished streaks of silver in his otherwise jet-black hair. His dark, almond eyes carry an intense, yet serene gaze that suggests a life of remarkable experience. His face is chisely handsome, marked by high cheekbones and a fine, angular jaw. Hints of old scars lend a rough appeal, tales of battles fought and won. 

He dresses in colors that mirror his regal and commanding demeanor. Deep shades of royal blue and gold accents adorn his clothing, a reflection of his aristocratic status. His clothes are exquisite, in rich textures, all spun from the finest of fabrics. Marco moves with a natural and effortless grace, every gesture a testament to his confidence and leadership. With an erect stance and measured steps, his movements carry an air of authority. He also has a palpable aura of charisma that captivates anyone in his presence.
