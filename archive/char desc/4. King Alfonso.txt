King Alfonso curiously threads the boundary of youth and old age, a kindly man in his mid-fifties with a dignified aura. His hair, black but beginning to be kissed by streaks of grey, is kept neatly trimmed and combed back, highlighting his high, intelligent forehead. His face, lined with age and wisdom, carries an imposing structure of a broad brow, a hawk-like nose, and deep-set grey eyes, full of wisdom and tenderness. The King's eyes, always carrying an intense gaze, reflect an earnest nature and a seasoned mind accustomed to discernment and critical thinking.

He is always attired in a rich, flowing robe of royal blue and gold, the colors of his kingdom, adorned with intricate motifs symbolizing the monarchy's heritage. Underneath it, he wears a cream-colored tunic and breeches, well-fitted and immaculate. A grand golden crown, studded with precious gems, crowns his regal appearance. His movements are purposeful, a marker of his royal upbringing, with a hint of elegant grace. Publically, he maintains a controlled, solemn demeanor, his mannerisms exuding authority and respect. His speeches are eloquently delivered, meant to inspire his followers and silence his critics. However, privately, he displays a warm charm to those close to him, smiling often while engaging in intellectual bantering.
