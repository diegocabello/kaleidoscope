Jean-Baptiste Casanova, a man of late middle age, strikes an imposing figure. His bracketing years have thickened his waist, but he remains brawny, bearing traces of his earlier martial background. His attire reflects the fashion of the mid-18th century, wearing a dark, roguish tricorne hat, an ornamental frock coat decked in shades of royal blue and gold trimmings. Underneath, an intricately embroidered waistcoat gleams beside his dark breeches, laced at the knee, and buckled shoes. 

With darkened, sun-weathered skin and prominent features lined by age and rigorous life, Casanova's face exudes a blend of strength, charm, and rough charm. His eyes, glittering with mischief and intelligence, are a stark contrast to his graying hair, neatly tied into a modest pigtail. Casanova moves with a confident swagger, his posture a perfect blend of charisma and weariness, reflecting both his adventurous spirit and the burden of his past. He has the tested chin of a man who’s seen and experienced hardship but retains a ready smile, hinting at tales of danger, romance, and victories. His gesticulations are flamboyant yet precise, an echo of both his formative years as a military man and his lifelong penchant for showmanship.
