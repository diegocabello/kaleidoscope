Gaetan-Joseph-Jacques Casanova, in his prime, would have been around his mid-thirties, an age that straddles the fine line between youthful vivacity and maturity. He is tall with a lean but muscular build, back straight and eyes beaming with the charm that has won him many hearts. His fair skin stands in striking contrast with his jet black hair, swept back in the fashion of the 18th-century and his dark, expressive eyes. His facial features are sharp and aristocratic, his nose roman and a mouth that breaks into a disarming smile, often revealing his pearly teeth. Casanova's attire flaires ostentatious elegance befitting an 18th-century gentleman; a flamboyantly decorated justaucorps of velvet or brocade, a waistcoat embroidered with golden thread, breeches of fine wool, and his eternally present tricorne hat, all adhering to a rich palette predominantly of royal blues, burgundies, or deep emerald greens.

Casanova bears an air of cavalier confidence that is irresistible, mirrored in his fluid, graceful movements. His gaze is intense and captivating, a tool he has mastered to draw people into his realm. Every gesture he makes, be it sipping from a wine glass or a simple doffing of his tricorne, is laden with dramatic finesse and theatrical flair. Often seen with a handkerchief in one hand or a walking cane, his aura is dominated by a warm sense of mischief, a signature trait that has marked many a tale about him. Irrespective of where he would be - a candle-lit salon or a moonlit tavern, Casanova never ceased to be the charismatic presence, the life, and soul of the scene.
