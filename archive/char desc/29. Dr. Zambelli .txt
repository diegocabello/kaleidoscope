Dr. Zambelli, a man in his late fifties, boasts a distinguished appearance that reflects his years of experience in the medical field. He bears striking spectacles perched on the bridge of his well-defined, straight nose, highlighting his piercing, intelligent blue eyes that seem to scrutinize everything in sight. His grey hair, neatly combed and parted to the side, gives him an air of respectability and wisdom. Arched eyebrows over thoughtful eyes and drawn lips convey a constant state of deep thinking.

His professional attire is impeccable: a light-colored button-up shirt - usually a soft hue of blue or white, under a neat, dark-toned suit that stands as a symbol of his refinement. A silver stethoscope, almost always around his neck, emphasizes his role. Dr. Zambelli is seldom seen without a folder or medical file in hand. His movements are always brisk and purposeful, with a defining mannerism of frequently adjusting his glasses or running his fingers through his hair while engaging in intellectual discussions.
