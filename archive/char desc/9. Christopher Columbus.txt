Christopher Columbus, a man of early middle age, was undeniably an emblematic figure of the late 15th century. Dressed in typical sailor's garb of the era, he sported a generously cut long-sleeved tunic made of rough, hard-wearing fabric, along with matching trousers, a belt, and a resplendent red surcoat, trimmed with fine gold embroidery. The color scheme was true to the prestige of his position as a captain, alternating between the muted tones of his everyday practical clothing and the vibrant hues of his ceremonial attire.

His physical appearance commanded attention, with weathered but ruddy skin from years spent at sea. His facial features were sharp, framed by a cascade of full-bodied, shoulder-length auburn hair and a well-trimmed beard. Columbus's deep-set, almond-shaped eyes were a steely grey, reflecting the determined and curious spirit within. His movements were direct, bearing a military precision and purposefulness hinting at his great navigational expertise. His mannerisms were of a serious and disciplined man, yet passion for exploration and discovery was evident in his animated discussions or when carefully sketching out his plans on a parchment map.
