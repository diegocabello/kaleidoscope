Francesco Casanova, a man seemingly in his mid-thirties, bears the distinguished look of an experienced soldier with keen eyes hinting at a turbulent past. His attire radiates an understated elegance, a leftover from his aristocratic upbringing. He dons an off-white cravat, under a waistcoat of navy blue brocade, paired expertly with a charcoal grey frock coat and breeches. Outwardly, the ensemble is completed by a black tricorn hat and high polished boots, adding a rugged appeal to his overall persona. His facial structure is defined, hard lines carved by a life of adventure and adversity, his strong jaw framed by dark, untamed facial hair. His eyes, a striking hazel, are hinting at a miscellany of experiences that span continents.

His movements are sharp, refined, mirroring the precision demanded by the brush strokes he uses in his artwork - a remaining echo of his training in the arts. Intimidating yet alluring, he carries an aura of mystery accentuated by his subdued color palette, punctuated only by the gleam of a small, gold locket around his neck. His complexion exudes a slightly weathered look, a testament to his many travels and being constantly at the mercy of the elements. He exudes a captivating confidence, his gestures eloquent, quietly commanding the respect and attention of those in his presence.
