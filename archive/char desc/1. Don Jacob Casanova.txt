Don Jacob Casanova was a man with a never-ending curiosity and contagious joie de vivre epitomizing the glamour and wit of 18th century Venice. Likely in his late 30s to 40s, he was of an average build with a marked charismatic appeal. His attire was typical of the period; augmented with elaborate ruffles at the wrists and neck, and polished shoes with golden buckles. Casanova's overall color scheme reflected his flamboyance - rich shades of royal blue, deep crimson and gold embroideries dominated his attire.

His face was structurally striking, with a firm jaw and high-set cheekbones, his eyes, a sharp and intelligent brown, twinkling with mischief and intrigue. A scruff of dark beard often adorned his face, along with a carefully maintained mustache. His movements commanded attention, graceful yet purposeful, a visual testament to his adept social maneuvering. His expressions were frequently playful or intrigued, with a ready smile that never quite left his lips. A great charmer and conversationalist, Casanova's quick wit and flirtatious behavior was a key part of his captivating character.
