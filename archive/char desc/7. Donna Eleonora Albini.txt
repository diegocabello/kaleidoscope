Donna Eleonora Albini is a woman of middle age, maintaining an elegant and commanding presence despite the passing of time. Time had etched laugh lines around her eyes, and her hair, once a vibrant chestnut, had begun to grey at the temples, a feature she cloaked with grace and confidence. She stood conservatively dressed, finding comfort and modesty in a dress of a subdued crimson, riddled with delicate embroideries, a cinched waist, long full skirts, and complemented by a lace shawl around her shoulders. 

She carried a high neck lace collar which complemented her elongated neck and gently curled hair that usually lay coiled neatly in a bun. Her bony hands held fast to a pair of glasses perched precariously on the ridge of her hawkish nose, indicating her involvement in intellectual pursuits. Her movements were deliberate, a gentle sway of her skirts while walking and a flick of the wrist when she talked. Eleonora's whole demeanor screamed of sophistication and authority, a figure influenced by the societal expectations of the respectable women of her historical context.
