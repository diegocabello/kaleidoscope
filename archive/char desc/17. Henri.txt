Henri, roughly in his mid-thirties, is a man with a contrasting demeanor. He has a surprisingly youthful face, a fine chiseled semi-square jaw with full lips that often curve in a half-smile. His deep-set eyes, stormy sea-green and bearing lines of subtle mirth, twinkle under a tousled mess of ebony hair. His skin lays the canvas to a sprinkle of freckles, lending him an almost boyish charm. He bears a rugged look through the slight stubble, kept meticulous in its disarray. His aesthetics often trick people into underestimating his age.

Henri's mannerism depicts a mixture of elegance and casual indifference, a gait that only comes from immense confidence. In the usual garb of a gentleman cut for his well-maintained physique — high-collared shirts of pastel hues, waistcoat, and trousers, he brings the old-world charm. He maintains a predominantly dark color scheme in matte shades because he likes the sense of mystery it perpetuates. The finishing touch is a watch on his wrist, always polished to perfection, enhancing his gentleman persona. Yet, beneath his façade, there’s an unpredictable mischievousness in his movements — a playful spin of his wrist or a sudden twirl on his heel — adding a tempting dose of flair.
