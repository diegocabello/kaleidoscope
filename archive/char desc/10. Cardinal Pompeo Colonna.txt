Cardinal Pompeo Colonna, in his late sixties, carries an air of ecclesiastical severity enhanced by decades of authority within the church. Distinguished by his thin, almost austere visage, his facial features are sharp, with a prominent nose and deep-set eyes that glint with intelligence and a measure of cunning. His hair is sparse and snowy white, complementing the pallor of his skin, evidence of a life majorly spent indoors, in scriptoriums or within the Vatican's ornate walls.

He's always seen in his cardinal's vestment, scarlet and gold in color which signifies his high-ranking position within the Church. His accessory, a gold pectoral cross is always seen resting on his chest; it shines against his velvet red cassock, indicating both piety and power. His hands, visibly aged with liver spots and veins, gesticulate emphatically when he speaks, a testament to the fiery spirit within him. His overall color scheme is a striking contrast of red and gold against his pale, almost parchment-like skin. His movements are deliberate, offering an image of a man who has learned patience and restraint, revealing just as much about the man behind the Cardinal as they do about the Cardinal Pompeo Colonna himself.
