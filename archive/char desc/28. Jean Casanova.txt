Jean Casanova, an exotic figure in his mid-thirties, stands tall and carries a youthful vivacity that belies his years. He is distinguished yet approachable, with warm, dark eyes that can either flash with devilish charm or soften to offer a glimpse of vulnerability. His hair, a vibrant shade of chestnut, is carefully styled in a manner popular during the 18th century, adding to his aura of elegance and sophistication. His complexion is olive toned, a testament to his Mediterranean heritage.

Cloaked in opulent attire that speaks to his affiliation with the wealthy at the European courts, Casanova's preferred color scheme is inspired by his Italian roots, flaunting rich hues of burgundy, gold and deep green. He consistently adorns himself in a well-tailored waistcoat, a fine lace cravat peeking from beneath the collar of his crisp, pale shirt. Slender breeches and polished shoes with silver buckles complete his attire. On stages of grand affairs, he moves with an effortless charm, his mannerisms betraying a refined predilection for theatricality - a sly smile here, a lingering touch there. His movements, much like his persona, are compellingly unpredictable yet always magnetically alluring.
