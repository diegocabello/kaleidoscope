Marzia Farusi, a woman in her late thirties, is a striking figure. Her attire tends to be traditionally Italian, often seen in long flowing dresses with intricate floral patterns in colors such as olive green, rich burgundy, or soothing turquoise, proudly displaying her cultural heritage. She's always immaculately put together, her clothes following the latest trends with a distinct Southern-Italian touch. A characteristic mix of feminine glamour and rustic charm. 

Her dark, almond-shaped eyes brim with empathy and wisdom, framed within a face of olive skin, her high cheekbones and pointed chin giving her an almost aristocratic bearing. The long, dark, and wavy hair that tumbles gracefully down her shoulders adds to her warm, Mediterranean look. Marzia's movements are both graceful and purposeful; as though every step she takes, every hand gesture she makes when speaking, is part of a dance only she knows the steps to. Her mannerisms, such as her proclivity for touching individuals she is conversing with to create connection, underline her passionate, yet gentle character. Despite bearing the signs of a life well-lived, there's a timeless elegance to her. With Marzia Farusi, it’s as if a beautiful Italian vineyard has come alive in human form.
