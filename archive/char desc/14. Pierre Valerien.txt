Pierre Valerien is depicted as a man in his late fifties, with an age-hardened face full of distinguishable lines and wrinkles. His silver hair is meticulously combed back, providing a stark contrast to his dark skin color. His eyes are deep-set, possessing a piercing icy blue hue which suggests wisdom and experience. Valerien tends to dress in earth-toned doublets and hose reminiscent of the late Renaissance period, often adorned with subtle embroidery. This minimalistic yet refined clothing style gives him a sense of elegance and authority.

With a tall, lean body, his movements are precise and well calculated, reflecting his careful and analytical mind. His long fingers often toy with a small golden locket he wears around his neck, a habit developed over years of contemplation and decision-making. His facial features are stern and handsome, with high cheekbones, a straight nose, and a full beard similar in color and grooming to his hair. His smile is rare and reserved, but when given, it emits a charm that is somewhat melancholic, indicating his rich life story.
