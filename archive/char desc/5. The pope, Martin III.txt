Martin III, the Pope, is an elderly man, likely in his seventies, bearing the burdens of his office on his bent shoulders. His slight hunch does not deter from the innate grandeur and quiet authority he holds. His constantly thoughtful and serene mannerisms reflect his holy position and his lifetime commitment to the spiritual life.

He dresses in traditional papal garb, his robe is pure white, signifying purity and holiness, adorned by a cross-shaped pendant, a symbol of his faith and his devotion to God. The white Zucchetto cap on his head completes his outfit. Age has left its mark on him, in the form of fine lines and wrinkles on his face with an almost translucent skin that suggests both fragility and resilience. His eyes, bluer than the deepest oceans, always carry a hint of wisdom and compassion. 

Despite his age, his movements are finely calibrated, with a remarkable sense of quiet grace to them, never too hurried or too slow. Master of restraint, he rarely lets his emotions appear on the surface, his countenance mostly calm and composed. Yet when he speaks, his voice carries the resonating power of his conviction, moving anyone within earshot.
