Don Francisco Casanova is a man of dignity and strong character, aged around the early sixties. His clothing follows the elegant styles of the late 18th century, with damask waistcoats richly embroidered in fine gold thread, knee-length trousers encased in silk stockings, and polished, black buckle shoes. He wears a white powdered wig, curled and tied at the back, a fashion trend of the aristocratic European era, complementing his sharp, intelligent, and slightly scored face.

His color scheme is often a harmonious blend of deep crimsons, ebony blacks, and luxurious gold accents, a reflection of his status. Behind a pair of refined spectacles lie piercing, hawk-like eyes; eyes that hold a depth of shrewd wisdom and piercing intelligence. His movements are methodical and deliberate, displaying a calculated grace. His overall manner exudes authority and gentle sophistication, while his smile has a charming and reassuring quality, making him a respected figure in his circle.
