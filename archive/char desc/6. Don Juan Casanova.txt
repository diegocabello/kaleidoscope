Dressed head to toe in attire characteristic of the 18th-century European high society, Don Juan Casanova carries an air of sophistication and affluence. He appears to be in his late thirties, although the life of indulgence he has led lends a somewhat weathered, yet undeniably charming quality to his countenance. His clothing includes a plum-colored, satin waistcoat, intricately embroidered and fastened with delicate gold buttons, richly complementing his olive complexion. A deep burgundy frock coat is draped over his broad shoulders, falling to his knees and swishing with gravitas as he walks, while white breeches and polished black boots complete his ensemble.

His face, framed by a cascade of wavy, shoulder-length, dark hair, is adorned with a striking set of intense, piercing hazel eyes, a high-arched nose, and a full, frivolously smiling mouth. A hint of stubble dusts his strong jawline, adding to his roguish appeal. Casanova's movements are as eloquent as his conversations - smooth, calculated, and undeniably charming. It's there in the way he holds his golden snuffbox, the dexterously playful manner in which he flips a coin, and the confident strut that commands attention. Despite his extravagant lifestyle, there is an unmistakable allure about him - a combination of his sly smirk, twinkling eyes, and gentlemanly manners that conceals his jovial adventures in opulence and desire.
