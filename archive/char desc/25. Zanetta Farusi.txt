Zanetta Farusi, a character in her late 40s, is subtly sophisticated, bearing an ageless beauty with a notable maturity that commands respect. Her skin is rich and sun-kissed, with fine laugh lines etched delicately at her eyes' corners. Behind her oval-shaped glasses, her warm, hazel eyes carry a quiet intelligence and resonated a calculated kindness. She has thick, greying, wavy hair often braided into a neat bun that speaks of her meticulosity, contributing an air of dignified grace to her overall aesthetic. 

She tends to favor a rich color palette of earthy tones, embracing shades of deep reds, browns, and greens, which mirror her grounded and nurturing nature. Her dress style reflects her rich cultural background and meticulous nature – she often wears well-tailored dresses or a blouse-skirt ensemble, adorned with intricate jewelry passed down through generations. Despite her age, Zanetta moves with a youthful vigor, yet every movement is carefully measured, echoing her quiet confidence and self-assuredness. Her mannerism is a balancing act of being assertive without being overwhelming, maintaining a warm and approachable demeanor.
