Jerome Farusi is a mature man, well in his mid-fifties, with each passing year etched onto his face in the form of wrinkles. His hair is an ashen grey, pulled back into a sophisticated ponytail that trails down his back. Streaks of original black color bear testimony to the vibrant, energetic man he was in his youth. A trimmed beard and mustache give his charismatic face a commanding appearance. His eyes, keen and bright, are of a deep hazel color, framed by thick eyebrows and hidden behind a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles.

Farusi's dress sense radiates dominance and wisdom - he often dons a meticulously tailored charcoal grey suit, with a white dress shirt underneath and a jet-black tie that complements his vest. A pocket watch dangles from his vest, a symbol of his punctuality. With years of experience, every movement he makes is calculated and deliberate, his pace steady and brisk. His voice is deep, resonating with firm authority, and he is a picture of composure, his mannerisms echoing his quiet strength. His color scheme involves shades of grey, black, and white predominantly, reflecting his structured and disciplined lifestyle.
