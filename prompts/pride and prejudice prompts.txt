sentence: He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. 


**chapter 3 row 16**
sentence: The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining, from an upper window, that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse. 


**chapter 3 row 17**
sentence: An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards despatched; 


**chapter 3 row 18**
sentence: and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all.

**chapter 3 row 20**
sentence: Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. 


**chapter 3 row 21**
sentence: She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; 


**chapter 3 row 22**
sentence: and she began to fear that he might always be flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. 


**chapter 3 row 23**

**chapter 3 row 26**
sentence: The girls grieved over such a number of ladies; 


**chapter 3 row 27**
sentence: but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London, his five sisters and a cousin. 


**chapter 3 row 28**
sentence: And when the party entered the assembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man. 


**chapter 3 row 29**
sentence: Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. 


**chapter 3 row 30**
sentence: His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. 


**chapter 3 row 31**
sentence: His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman;

**chapter 3 row 33**
sentence: The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; 


**chapter 3 row 34**
sentence: for he was discovered to be proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; 


**chapter 3 row 35**
sentence: and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend. 


**chapter 3 row 36**
sentence: Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. 


**chapter 3 row 37**
sentence: Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. 


**chapter 3 row 38**
sentence: What a contrast between him and his friend! 


**chapter 3 row 39**
sentence: Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. 


**chapter 3 row 40**
sentence: His character was decided. 


**chapter 3 row 41**
sentence: He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. 


**chapter 3 row 42**
sentence: Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters. 


**chapter 3 row 43**
sentence: Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; 


**chapter 3 row 44**
sentence: and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it.

**chapter 4 row 34**

**chapter 4 row 35**
sentence: and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them. 


**chapter 4 row 36**

**chapter 4 row 37**
sentence: not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it;

**chapter 4 row 39**
sentence: They were rather handsome; 


**chapter 4 row 40**

sentence: had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; 


**chapter 4 row 42**
sentence: were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank; 


**chapter 4 row 43**
sentence: and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others. 


**chapter 4 row 44**
sentence: They were of a respectable family in the north of England; 


**chapter 4 row 45**
sentence: a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade. 


**chapter 4 row 46**
sentence: Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. 


**chapter 4 row 47**
sentence: Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; 


**chapter 4 row 48**
sentence: but, as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase. 


**chapter 4 row 49**
sentence: His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; 


**chapter 4 row 50**
sentence: but though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table; 


**chapter 4 row 51**
sentence: nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. 


**chapter 4 row 52**
sentence: Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to look at Netherfield House. 


**chapter 4 row 53**
sentence: He did look at it, and into it, for half an hour; 


**chapter 4 row 54**
sentence: was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately. 


**chapter 4 row 55**
sentence: Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a great opposition of character. 


**chapter 4 row 56**
sentence: Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. 


**chapter 4 row 57**
sentence: On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. 


**chapter 4 row 58**
sentence: In understanding, Darcy was the superior. 


**chapter 4 row 59**
sentence: Bingley was by no means deficient; but Darcy was clever. 


**chapter 4 row 60**
sentence: He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not inviting. 


**chapter 4 row 61**
sentence: In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. 


**chapter 4 row 62**
sentence: Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually giving offence. 


**chapter 4 row 63**
sentence: The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. 


**chapter 4 row 64**
sentence: Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life; 


**chapter 4 row 65**
sentence: everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; 


**chapter 4 row 66**
sentence: there had been no formality, no stiffness; 


**chapter 4 row 67**
sentence: he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; 


**chapter 4 row 68**
sentence: and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. 


**chapter 4 row 69**
sentence: Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. 


**chapter 4 row 70**
sentence: Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too much. 


**chapter 4 row 71**
sentence: Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; 


**chapter 4 row 72**
sentence: but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they should not object to know more of. 


**chapter 4 row 73**
sentence: Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose. 


**chapter 5 row 3**
sentence: CHAPTER  V.
ITHIN a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. 


**chapter 5 row 4**
sentence: Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. 


**chapter 5 row 5**
sentence: The distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. 


**chapter 5 row 6**
sentence: It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town; 


**chapter 5 row 7**
sentence: and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; 


**chapter 5 row 8**
sentence: where he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. 


**chapter 5 row 9**
sentence: For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. 


**chapter 5 row 10**
sentence: By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him courteous. 


**chapter 5 row 11**
sentence: Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. 


**chapter 5 row 12**
sentence: They had several children. 


**chapter 5 row 13**
sentence: The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend. 


**chapter 5 row 14**
sentence: That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; 


**chapter 5 row 15**

sentence: Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. 


**chapter 6 row 52**
sentence: Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; 


**chapter 6 row 53**
sentence: and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. 


**chapter 6 row 54**
sentence: But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes.

sentence: After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display. 


**chapter 6 row 79**
sentence: Mary had neither genius nor taste; 


**chapter 6 row 80**
sentence: and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. 


**chapter 6 row 81**

**chapter 7 row 3**
sentence: CHAPTER  VII.
R. BENNET’S property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; 


**chapter 7 row 4**
sentence: and their mother’s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. 


**chapter 7 row 5**
sentence: Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds. 


**chapter 7 row 6**
sentence: She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade. 


**chapter 7 row 7**
sentence: The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; 


**chapter 7 row 8**
sentence: a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. 


**chapter 7 row 9**
sentence: The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions: their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; 


**chapter 7 row 10**
sentence: and, however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. 


**chapter 7 row 11**
sentence: At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; 


**chapter 7 row 12**
sentence: it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the head-quarters. 


**chapter 7 row 13**
sentence: Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. 


**chapter 7 row 14**
sentence: Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. 


**chapter 7 row 15**
sentence: Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. 


**chapter 7 row 16**
sentence: Mr. Philips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before. 


**chapter 7 row 17**
sentence: They could talk of nothing but officers; 


**chapter 7 row 18**
sentence: and Mr. Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign. 


**chapter 7 row 19**
sentence: After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed,—

sentence: In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise. 


**chapter 7 row 96**
sentence: She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. 


**chapter 7 row 97**
sentence: That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; 


**chapter 7 row 98**
sentence: and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. 


**chapter 7 row 99**
sentence: She was received, however, very politely by them; 


**chapter 7 row 100**
sentence: and in their brother’s manners there was something better than politeness—there was good-humour and kindness. 


**chapter 7 row 101**
sentence: Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. 


**chapter 7 row 102**
sentence: The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. 


**chapter 7 row 103**
sentence: The latter was thinking only of his breakfast. 


**chapter 7 row 104**
sentence: Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. 


**chapter 7 row 105**
sentence: Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. 


**chapter 7 row 106**
sentence: Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; 


**chapter 7 row 107**
sentence: and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. 


**chapter 7 row 108**
sentence: She was not equal, however, to much conversation; 


**chapter 7 row 109**
sentence: and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. 


**chapter 7 row 110**
sentence: Elizabeth silently attended her. 


**chapter 7 row 111**
sentence: When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; 


**chapter 7 row 112**
sentence: and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. 


**chapter 7 row 113**
sentence: The apothecary came; 


**chapter 7 row 114**
sentence: and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; 


**chapter 7 row 115**
sentence: advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. 


**chapter 7 row 116**
sentence: The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. 


**chapter 7 row 117**
sentence: Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were the other ladies often absent; 


**chapter 7 row 118**
sentence: the gentlemen being out, they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere. 


**chapter 7 row 119**
sentence: When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. 


**chapter 7 row 120**
sentence: Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. 


**chapter 7 row 121**
sentence: Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring back a supply of clothes. 


**chapter 8 row 3**
sentence: CHAPTER  VIII. 


**chapter 8 row 4**
sentence: T five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. 


**chapter 8 row 5**
sentence: To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very favourable answer. 


**chapter 8 row 6**
sentence: Jane was by no means better. 


**chapter 8 row 7**
sentence: The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; 


**chapter 8 row 8**
sentence: and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike. 


**chapter 8 row 9**
sentence: Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. 


**chapter 8 row 10**
sentence: His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing; 


**chapter 8 row 11**
sentence: and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. 


**chapter 8 row 12**
sentence: She had very little notice from any but him. 


**chapter 8 row 13**
sentence: Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; 


**chapter 8 row 14**
sentence: and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her. 


**chapter 8 row 15**
sentence: When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. 


**chapter 8 row 16**
sentence: Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed,—a mixture of pride and impertinence: she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.

**chapter 8 row 51**
sentence: With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. 


**chapter 8 row 52**
sentence: She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself.

**chapter 12 row 6**

**chapter 12 row 17**

**chapter 15 row 4**

**chapter 15 row 5**
sentence: the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; 


**chapter 15 row 6**
sentence: and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance. 


**chapter 15 row 7**
sentence: The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; 


**chapter 15 row 8**
sentence: but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. 


**chapter 15 row 9**
sentence: A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; 


**chapter 15 row 10**
sentence: and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility. 


**chapter 15 row 11**

**chapter 15 row 26**
sentence: Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; 


**chapter 15 row 27**
sentence: and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; 


**chapter 15 row 28**

**chapter 15 row 29**
sentence: Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. 


**chapter 15 row 30**

**chapter 15 row 31**
sentence: and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; 


**chapter 15 row 32**
sentence: and 


**chapter 15 row 33**
sentence: Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and go. 


**chapter 15 row 34**
sentence: In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. 


**chapter 15 row 35**

**chapter 15 row 36**
sentence: Their eyes were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them. 


**chapter 15 row 37**
sentence: But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with an officer on the other side of the way. 


**chapter 15 row 38**
sentence: The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. 


**chapter 15 row 39**
sentence: All were struck with the stranger’s air, all wondered who he could be; 


**chapter 15 row 40**

**chapter 15 row 41**

sentence: Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. 


**chapter 16 row 3**
sentence: CHAPTER  XVI. 


**chapter 16 row 4**
sentence: S no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; 


**chapter 16 row 5**
sentence: and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in the house. 


**chapter 16 row 6**
sentence: When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; 


**chapter 16 row 7**
sentence: a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; 


**chapter 16 row 8**
sentence: but when Mrs. Philips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor, when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper’s room. 


**chapter 16 row 9**

**chapter 16 row 11**
sentence: To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantel-piece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. 


**chapter 16 row 12**
sentence: It was over at last, however. 


**chapter 16 row 13**
sentence: The gentlemen did approach: and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. 


**chapter 16 row 14**
sentence: The officers of the ——shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party; 


**chapter 16 row 15**
sentence: but Mr, Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced stuffy uncle Philips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room. 


**chapter 16 row 16**
sentence: Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; 


**chapter 16 row 17**
sentence: and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the probability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker. 


**chapter 16 row 18**
sentence: With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; 


**chapter 16 row 19**
sentence: to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; 


**chapter 16 row 20**
sentence: but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.

sentence: Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. 


**chapter 16 row 25**
sentence: At first there seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; 


**chapter 16 row 26**
sentence: but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular. 


**chapter 16 row 27**
sentence: Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told, the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. 


**chapter 16 row 28**

**chapter 16 row 182**

**chapter 16 row 183**
sentence: There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. 


**chapter 16 row 184**

**chapter 16 row 185**

**chapter 16 row 186**
sentence: She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; 


**chapter 16 row 187**
sentence: but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. 


**chapter 16 row 188**
sentence: Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; 


**chapter 16 row 189**
sentence: and Mr. Collins, in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Philips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.

**chapter 17 row 6**
sentence: and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. 


**chapter 17 row 7**

**chapter 17 row 29**
sentence: The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; 


**chapter 17 row 30**
sentence: Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. 


**chapter 17 row 31**
sentence: The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. 


**chapter 17 row 32**
sentence: To the rest of the family they paid little attention; 


**chapter 17 row 33**
sentence: avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. 


**chapter 17 row 34**
sentence: They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities. 


**chapter 17 row 35**
sentence: The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. 


**chapter 17 row 36**
sentence: Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. 


**chapter 17 row 37**
sentence: Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; 


**chapter 17 row 38**
sentence: and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look and behaviour. 


**chapter 17 row 39**
sentence: The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person; 


**chapter 17 row 40**
sentence: for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. 


**chapter 17 row 41**
sentence: And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.

**chapter 17 row 45**
sentence: Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s amusement; 


**chapter 17 row 46**
sentence: and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke, either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance. 


**chapter 17 row 47**
sentence: “I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency;

**chapter 17 row 52**
sentence: She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead!—her liveliness had been never worse timed. 


**chapter 17 row 53**
sentence: There was no help for it, however. 


**chapter 17 row 54**
sentence: Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. 


**chapter 17 row 55**
sentence: She was not the better pleased with his gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. 


**chapter 17 row 56**
sentence: It now first struck her, that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. 


**chapter 17 row 57**
sentence: The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; 


**chapter 17 row 58**
sentence: and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her. 


**chapter 17 row 59**
sentence: Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. 


**chapter 17 row 60**
sentence: Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and, till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him. 


**chapter 17 row 61**
sentence: If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time; 


**chapter 17 row 62**
sentence: for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. 


**chapter 17 row 63**
sentence: No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after; the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. 


**chapter 17 row 64**
sentence: Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; 


**chapter 17 row 65**
sentence: and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia. 


**chapter 18 row 3**
sentence: CHAPTER  XVIII. 


**chapter 18 row 4**
sentence: ILL Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. 


**chapter 18 row 5**
sentence: The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. 


**chapter 18 row 6**
sentence: She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. 


**chapter 18 row 7**
sentence: But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s pleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; 


**chapter 18 row 8**
sentence: and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; 


**chapter 18 row 9**
sentence: adding, with a significant smile,— 


**chapter 18 row 10**
sentence: “I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.” 
frame: speaker 


**chapter 18 row 11**
sentence: This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth; 


**chapter 18 row 12**
sentence: and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. 


**chapter 18 row 13**
sentence: Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. 


**chapter 18 row 14**
sentence: She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her. 


**chapter 18 row 15**
sentence: But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; 


**chapter 18 row 16**
sentence: and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; 


**chapter 18 row 17**
sentence: and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. 


**chapter 18 row 18**
sentence: The two first dances, however, brought a return of distress: they were dances of mortification. 


**chapter 18 row 19**
sentence: Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. 


**chapter 18 row 20**
sentence: The moment of her release from him was ecstasy. 


**chapter 18 row 21**
sentence: She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. 


**chapter 18 row 22**
sentence: When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. 


**chapter 18 row 23**

**chapter 18 row 30**
sentence: Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it. 


**chapter 18 row 31**
sentence: They stood for some time without speaking a word; 


**chapter 18 row 32**
sentence: and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at first, was resolved not to break it; 


**chapter 18 row 33**
sentence: till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. 


**chapter 18 row 34**

**chapter 22 row 28**
sentence: excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; 


**chapter 22 row 29**
sentence: and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James’s. 


**chapter 22 row 30**
sentence: The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion. 


**chapter 22 row 31**
sentence: The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; 


**chapter 22 row 32**
sentence: and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. 


**chapter 22 row 33**
sentence: Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. 


**chapter 22 row 34**
sentence: She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. 


**chapter 22 row 35**
sentence: Her reflections were in general satisfactory. 


**chapter 22 row 36**
sentence: Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. 


**chapter 22 row 37**
sentence: But still he would be her husband. 


**chapter 22 row 38**
sentence: Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. 


**chapter 22 row 39**
sentence: This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. 


**chapter 22 row 40**
sentence: The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. 


**chapter 22 row 41**
sentence: Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; 


**chapter 22 row 42**
sentence: and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. 


**chapter 22 row 43**
sentence: She resolved to give her the information herself; 


**chapter 22 row 44**
sentence: and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. 


**chapter 22 row 45**
sentence: A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; 


**chapter 22 row 46**
sentence: for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love. 


**chapter 22 row 47**
sentence: As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; 


**chapter 22 row 48**
sentence: and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them. 


**chapter 22 row 49**
sentence: “My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive;

**chapter 22 row 51**

frame: spoken about 
speaker: Collins 


**chapter 22 row 61**
sentence: With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. 


**chapter 22 row 62**
sentence: Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. 


**chapter 22 row 63**
sentence: She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her; 


**chapter 22 row 64**
sentence: and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. 


**chapter 22 row 65**
sentence: But on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away. 


**chapter 22 row 66**
sentence: Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before. 


**chapter 22 row 67**
sentence: The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself; 


**chapter 22 row 68**
sentence: and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,— 


**chapter 22 row 69**
sentence: “Engaged to Mr. Collins!

**chapter 22 row 70**

**chapter 22 row 72**

**chapter 22 row 73**
sentence: “Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?

sentence: Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”

sentence: But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; 


**chapter 22 row 76**
sentence: and, making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.

**chapter 23 row 3**
sentence: CHAPTER  XXIII. 


**chapter 23 row 4**
sentence: LIZABETH was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family. 


**chapter 23 row 5**
sentence: With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,—to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; 


**chapter 23 row 6**
sentence: for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; 


**chapter 23 row 7**
sentence: and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,— 


**chapter 23 row 8**
sentence: “Good Lord! 
frame: speaker 


**chapter 23 row 9**
sentence: Sir William, how can you tell such a story? 
frame: spoken about 


**chapter 23 row 10**
sentence: Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?” 
frame: spoken about 


**chapter 23 row 11**
sentence: Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried him through it all; 


**chapter 23 row 12**
sentence: and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy. 


**chapter 23 row 13**
sentence: Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; 


**chapter 23 row 14**
sentence: and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters, by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London. 


**chapter 23 row 15**
sentence: Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; 


**chapter 23 row 16**
sentence: but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. 


**chapter 23 row 17**
sentence: In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; 


**chapter 23 row 18**
sentence: secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; 


**chapter 23 row 19**
sentence: thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; 


**chapter 23 row 20**
sentence: and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. 


**chapter 23 row 21**
sentence: Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; 


**chapter 23 row 22**
sentence: and the other, that she herself had been barbarously used by them all; 


**chapter 23 row 23**
sentence: and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. 


**chapter 23 row 24**
sentence: Nothing could console and nothing appease her. 


**chapter 23 row 25**
sentence: Nor did that day wear out her resentment. 


**chapter 23 row 26**
sentence: A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude; 


**chapter 23 row 27**
sentence: and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. 


**chapter 23 row 28**
sentence: Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; 


**chapter 23 row 29**
sentence: for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! 


**chapter 23 row 30**
sentence: Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; 


**chapter 23 row 31**
sentence: nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. 


**chapter 23 row 32**
sentence: Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; 


**chapter 23 row 33**
sentence: and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton. 


**chapter 23 row 34**
sentence: Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; 


**chapter 23 row 35**
sentence: and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away. 


**chapter 23 row 36**
sentence: Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; 


**chapter 23 row 37**
sentence: and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. 


**chapter 23 row 38**
sentence: Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return. 


**chapter 23 row 39**
sentence: Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. 


**chapter 23 row 40**
sentence: The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. 


**chapter 23 row 41**
sentence: After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; 


**chapter 23 row 42**
sentence: for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men. 


**chapter 23 row 43**
sentence: Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. 


**chapter 23 row 44**
sentence: On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. 


**chapter 23 row 45**
sentence: It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. 


**chapter 23 row 46**
sentence: She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. 


**chapter 23 row 47**
sentence: Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued absence. 


**chapter 23 row 48**
sentence: Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. 


**chapter 23 row 49**
sentence: Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; 


**chapter 23 row 50**
sentence: a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood. 


**chapter 23 row 51**
sentence: Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. 


**chapter 23 row 52**
sentence: Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently recurring. 


**chapter 23 row 53**
sentence: The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters, and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment. 


**chapter 23 row 54**
sentence: As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing; 


**chapter 23 row 55**
sentence: and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. 


**chapter 23 row 56**
sentence: But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. 


**chapter 23 row 57**
sentence: It needed all Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity. 


**chapter 23 row 58**
sentence: Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. 


**chapter 23 row 59**
sentence: He was too happy, however, to need much attention; 


**chapter 23 row 60**
sentence: and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. 


**chapter 23 row 61**
sentence: The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed. 


**chapter 23 row 62**
sentence: Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. 


**chapter 23 row 63**
sentence: The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. 


**chapter 23 row 64**
sentence: The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. 


**chapter 23 row 65**
sentence: As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. 


**chapter 23 row 66**
sentence: Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; 


**chapter 23 row 67**
sentence: and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. 


**chapter 23 row 68**
sentence: She complained bitterly of all this to her husband. 


**chapter 23 row 69**
sentence: “Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take my place in it!”

**chapter 24 row 3**

ISS BINGLEY’S letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. 


**chapter 24 row 4**
sentence: The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country. 


**chapter 24 row 5**
sentence: Hope was over, entirely over; 


**chapter 24 row 6**
sentence: and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. 


**chapter 24 row 7**
sentence: Miss Darcy’s praise occupied the chief of it. 


**chapter 24 row 8**
sentence: Her many attractions were again dwelt on; 


**chapter 24 row 9**
sentence: and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. 


**chapter 24 row 10**
sentence: She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture. 


**chapter 24 row 11**
sentence: Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. 


**chapter 24 row 12**
sentence: Her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others. 


**chapter 24 row 13**
sentence: To Caroline’s assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no credit. 


**chapter 24 row 14**
sentence: That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; 


**chapter 24 row 15**
sentence: and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations. 


**chapter 24 row 16**
sentence: Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best; 


**chapter 24 row 17**
sentence: but her sister’s was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. 


**chapter 24 row 18**
sentence: It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. 


**chapter 24 row 19**
sentence: She could think of nothing else; 


**chapter 24 row 20**
sentence: and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference; 


**chapter 24 row 21**
sentence: whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; 


**chapter 24 row 22**
sentence: whichever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded. 


**chapter 24 row 23**
sentence: A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; 


**chapter 24 row 24**
sentence: but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,—

**chapter 26 row 63**
sentence: Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over; 


**chapter 26 row 64**

**chapter 26 row 65**
sentence: Charlotte’s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; 


**chapter 26 row 66**
sentence: though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. 


**chapter 26 row 67**

**chapter 26 row 68**

**chapter 26 row 74**

**chapter 26 row 87**

**chapter 26 row 88**
sentence: She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. 


**chapter 26 row 89**
sentence: After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; 


**chapter 26 row 90**
sentence: but the shortness of her stay, and, yet more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. 


**chapter 26 row 91**

**chapter 26 row 126**
sentence: Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. 


**chapter 26 row 127**
sentence: Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. 


**chapter 26 row 128**
sentence: The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; 


**chapter 26 row 129**
sentence: but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.

**chapter 27 row 4**
sentence: ITH no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. 


**chapter 27 row 5**
sentence: March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. 


**chapter 27 row 6**
sentence: She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; 


**chapter 27 row 7**
sentence: but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. 


**chapter 27 row 8**
sentence: Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. 


**chapter 27 row 9**
sentence: There was novelty in the scheme; 


**chapter 27 row 10**
sentence: and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. 


**chapter 27 row 11**
sentence: The journey would, moreover, give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay.

**chapter 27 row 13**

**chapter 27 row 14**
sentence: The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as perfect as plan could be. 


**chapter 27 row 15**
sentence: The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter. 


**chapter 27 row 16**
sentence: The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. 


**chapter 27 row 17**
sentence: His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; 


**chapter 27 row 18**
sentence: and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her—their opinion of everybody—would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; 


**chapter 27 row 19**
sentence: and she parted from him convinced, that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing. 


**chapter 27 row 20**
sentence: Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. 


**chapter 27 row 21**
sentence: Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. 


**chapter 27 row 22**
sentence: Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William’s too long. 


**chapter 27 row 23**
sentence: He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information. 


**chapter 27 row 24**
sentence: It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. 


**chapter 27 row 25**
sentence: As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. 


**chapter 27 row 26**
sentence: On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. 


**chapter 27 row 27**
sentence: All was joy and kindness. 


**chapter 27 row 28**
sentence: The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres. 


**chapter 27 row 29**
sentence: Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. 


**chapter 27 row 30**
sentence: Their first subject was her sister; 


**chapter 27 row 31**
sentence: and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. 


**chapter 27 row 32**
sentence: It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. 


**chapter 27 row 33**
sentence: Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.

sentence: CHAPTER XXVIII. 


**chapter 28 row 4**
sentence: VERY object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; 


**chapter 28 row 5**
sentence: and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; 


**chapter 28 row 6**
sentence: for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight. 


**chapter 28 row 7**
sentence: When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. 


**chapter 28 row 8**
sentence: The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. 


**chapter 28 row 9**
sentence: Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants. 


**chapter 28 row 10**
sentence: At length the Parsonage was discernible. 


**chapter 28 row 11**
sentence: The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. 


**chapter 28 row 12**
sentence: Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. 


**chapter 28 row 13**
sentence: In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. 


**chapter 28 row 14**
sentence: Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. 


**chapter 28 row 15**
sentence: She saw instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage: his formal civility was just what it had been; 


**chapter 28 row 16**
sentence: and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family. 


**chapter 28 row 17**
sentence: They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; 


**chapter 28 row 18**
sentence: and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s offers of refreshment. 


**chapter 28 row 19**
sentence: Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; 


**chapter 28 row 20**
sentence: and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect, and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. 


**chapter 28 row 21**
sentence: But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance; 


**chapter 28 row 22**
sentence: and rather looked with wonder at her friend, that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. 


**chapter 28 row 23**
sentence: When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. 


**chapter 28 row 24**
sentence: Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. 


**chapter 28 row 25**
sentence: After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. 


**chapter 28 row 26**
sentence: To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; 


**chapter 28 row 27**
sentence: and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. 


**chapter 28 row 28**
sentence: Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. 


**chapter 28 row 29**
sentence: He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. 


**chapter 28 row 30**
sentence: But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. 


**chapter 28 row 31**
sentence: It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground. 


**chapter 28 row 32**
sentence: From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows; 


**chapter 28 row 33**
sentence: but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; 


**chapter 28 row 34**
sentence: and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s help. 


**chapter 28 row 35**
sentence: It was rather small, but well built and convenient; 


**chapter 28 row 36**
sentence: and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. 


**chapter 28 row 37**
sentence: When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten. 


**chapter 28 row 38**
sentence: She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. 


**chapter 28 row 39**
sentence: It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed,— 


**chapter 28 row 40**
sentence: “Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her.

sentence: She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.” 
frame: spoken about 


**chapter 28 row 50**
sentence: The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; 


**chapter 28 row 51**
sentence: and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. 


**chapter 28 row 52**
sentence: She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. 


**chapter 28 row 53**
sentence: A lively imagination soon settled it all. 


**chapter 28 row 54**
sentence: About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; 


**chapter 28 row 55**
sentence: and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. 


**chapter 28 row 56**
sentence: She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,— 


**chapter 28 row 57**

**chapter 28 row 83**
sentence: At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. 


**chapter 28 row 84**
sentence: Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day. 


**chapter 29 row 3**
sentence: CHAPTER  XXIX. 


**chapter 29 row 4**
sentence: R. COLLINS’S triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. 


**chapter 29 row 5**
sentence: The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; 


**chapter 29 row 6**
sentence: and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady Catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.

**chapter 29 row 13**
sentence: Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings. 


**chapter 29 row 14**
sentence: Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them. 


**chapter 29 row 15**
sentence: When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,— 


**chapter 29 row 16**
sentence: “Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.

frame: spoken about 


**chapter 29 row 21**
sentence: While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. 


**chapter 29 row 22**
sentence: Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company; 


**chapter 29 row 23**
sentence: and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James’s. 


**chapter 29 row 24**
sentence: As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. 


**chapter 29 row 25**
sentence: Every park has its beauty and its prospects; 


**chapter 29 row 26**
sentence: and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh. 


**chapter 29 row 27**
sentence: When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. 


**chapter 29 row 28**
sentence: Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. 


**chapter 29 row 29**
sentence: She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation. 


**chapter 29 row 30**
sentence: From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. 


**chapter 29 row 31**
sentence: Her Ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; 


**chapter 29 row 32**
sentence: and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary. 


**chapter 29 row 33**
sentence: In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; 


**chapter 29 row 34**
sentence: and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. 


**chapter 29 row 35**
sentence: Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. 


**chapter 29 row 36**
sentence: Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. 


**chapter 29 row 37**
sentence: Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. 


**chapter 29 row 38**
sentence: She was not rendered formidable by silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; 


**chapter 29 row 39**
sentence: and, from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented. 


**chapter 29 row 40**
sentence: When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her being so thin and so small. 


**chapter 29 row 41**
sentence: There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. 


**chapter 29 row 42**
sentence: Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her features, though not plain, were insignificant; 


**chapter 29 row 43**
sentence: and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes. 


**chapter 29 row 44**
sentence: After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. 


**chapter 29 row 45**
sentence: The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants, and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; 


**chapter 29 row 46**
sentence: and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her Ladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. 


**chapter 29 row 47**
sentence: He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity; 


**chapter 29 row 48**
sentence: and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. 


**chapter 29 row 49**
sentence: But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. 


**chapter 29 row 50**
sentence: The party did not supply much conversation. 


**chapter 29 row 51**
sentence: Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all the dinnertime. 


**chapter 29 row 52**
sentence: Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed. 


**chapter 29 row 53**
sentence: Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire. 


**chapter 29 row 54**
sentence: When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted. 


**chapter 29 row 55**
sentence: She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; 


**chapter 29 row 56**
sentence: told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. 


**chapter 29 row 57**
sentence: Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an occasion for dictating to others. 


**chapter 29 row 58**
sentence: In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. 


**chapter 29 row 59**
sentence: She asked her at different times how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother’s maiden name? 


**chapter 29 row 60**
sentence: Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.

speaker: Elizabeth 


**chapter 29 row 122**
sentence: Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; 


**chapter 29 row 123**
sentence: and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence. 


**chapter 29 row 124**

**chapter 29 row 126**
sentence: When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables were placed. 


**chapter 29 row 127**
sentence: Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; 


**chapter 29 row 128**
sentence: and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. 


**chapter 29 row 129**
sentence: Their table was superlatively stupid. 


**chapter 29 row 130**
sentence: Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. 


**chapter 29 row 131**
sentence: A great deal more passed at the other table. 


**chapter 29 row 132**
sentence: Lady Catherine was generally speaking—stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. 


**chapter 29 row 133**
sentence: Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many. 


**chapter 29 row 134**
sentence: Sir William did not say much. 


**chapter 29 row 135**
sentence: He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names. 


**chapter 29 row 136**
sentence: When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. 


**chapter 29 row 137**
sentence: The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. 


**chapter 29 row 138**
sentence: From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; 


**chapter 29 row 139**
sentence: and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins’s side, and as many bows on Sir William’s, they departed. 


**chapter 29 row 140**
sentence: As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. 


**chapter 29 row 141**
sentence: But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyship’s praise into his own hands. 


**chapter 30 row 3**
sentence: CHAPTER  XXX. 


**chapter 30 row 4**
sentence: IR WILLIAM stayed only a week at Hunsford; 


**chapter 30 row 5**
sentence: but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. 


**chapter 30 row 6**
sentence: While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration; 


**chapter 30 row 7**
sentence: for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room, which fronted the road. 


**chapter 30 row 8**
sentence: The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. 


**chapter 30 row 9**
sentence: Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use; 


**chapter 30 row 10**
sentence: it was a better sized room, and had a pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; 


**chapter 30 row 11**
sentence: and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement. 


**chapter 30 row 12**
sentence: From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. 


**chapter 30 row 13**
sentence: She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out. 


**chapter 30 row 14**
sentence: Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; 


**chapter 30 row 15**
sentence: and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. 


**chapter 30 row 16**
sentence: Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. 


**chapter 30 row 17**
sentence: She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; 


**chapter 30 row 18**
sentence: found fault with the arrangement of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; 


**chapter 30 row 19**
sentence: and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family. 


**chapter 30 row 20**
sentence: Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; 


**chapter 30 row 21**
sentence: and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty. 


**chapter 30 row 22**
sentence: The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; 


**chapter 30 row 23**
sentence: and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. 


**chapter 30 row 24**
sentence: Their other engagements were few, as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. 


**chapter 30 row 25**
sentence: This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. 


**chapter 30 row 26**
sentence: Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity. 


**chapter 30 row 27**
sentence: In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. 


**chapter 30 row 28**
sentence: Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. 


**chapter 30 row 29**
sentence: Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks; 


**chapter 30 row 30**
sentence: and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself. 


**chapter 30 row 31**
sentence: His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; 


**chapter 30 row 32**
sentence: for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have 


**chapter 30 row 33**
sentence: the earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. 


**chapter 30 row 34**
sentence: On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. 


**chapter 30 row 35**
sentence: There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ——; 


**chapter 30 row 36**
sentence: and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. 


**chapter 30 row 37**
sentence: Charlotte had seen them from her husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,— 


**chapter 30 row 38**
sentence: “I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. 
frame: speaker 


**chapter 30 row 39**
sentence: Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.” 
frame: spoken about 


**chapter 30 row 40**
sentence: Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. 


**chapter 30 row 41**
sentence: Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. 


**chapter 30 row 42**
sentence: Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins; 


**chapter 30 row 43**
sentence: and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. 


**chapter 30 row 44**
sentence: Elizabeth merely courtesied to him, without saying a word. 


**chapter 30 row 45**
sentence: Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; 


**chapter 30 row 46**
sentence: but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. 


**chapter 30 row 47**
sentence: At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family. 


**chapter 30 row 48**
sentence: She answered him in the usual way; and, after a moment’s pause, added,— 


**chapter 30 row 49**
sentence: “My eldest sister has been in town these three months. 
frame: speaker 


**chapter 30 row 50**
sentence: Have you never happened to see her there?” 
frame: spoken about 


**chapter 30 row 51**
sentence: She was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; 


**chapter 30 row 52**
sentence: and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. 


**chapter 30 row 53**
sentence: The subject was pursued no further, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.
