CHAPTER  I.
Down the Rabbit-Hole
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”
prompt: a blonde-haired 14-year-old girl  wearing a blue polka dotted dress is looking at a red book laying next to another 14-year-old girl  wearing a grey dress. There is a tree above them.

**chapter 1 bit 2**
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
prompt: a blonde haired 14-year-old girl  wearing a blue dress lying on green grass next to a river smiling and looking sleepy. There is warm sunlight. A white rabbit running next to her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear!Oh dear!I shall be late!”

**chapter 1 bit 4**
(when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it,
prompt: a rabbit wearing a suit takes a watch out of its pocket. A blonde haired blue eyed 14-year-old girl  in a blue dress next to it some distance aways sits up with a surprised look on her face.

and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.

“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!How brave they’ll all think me at home!Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!”(Which was very likely true.)
